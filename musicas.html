            <p>
                It's late and I'm awake<br>
                Staring at the wall<br>
                Open up my window<br>
                Head floats out the door<br>
                No one else around<br>
                The shimmer takes my eye<br>
                I lift my head<br>
                Blinded by the sky<br>
                Feel my weight in front<br>
                Following the sound<br>
                Moves away so fast<br>
                Fall down to the ground<br>
                I know there's more to come<br>
                Jump back to my feet<br>
                Now I only see ahead of me<br>
                Chasing down the street<br>
                Gave my love to a shooting star<br>
                But she moves so fast<br>
                That I can't keep up<br>
                I'm chasing<br>
                I'm in love with a shooting star<br>
                But she moves so fast<br>
                When she falls then<br>
                I'll be waiting<br>
                Gave my love to a shooting star<br>
                But she moves so fast<br>
                That I can't keep up<br>
                I'm chasing<br>
                I'm in love with a shooting star<br>
                But she moves so fast<br>
                When she falls then<br>
                I'll be waiting<br>
                Gave my love to a shooting star<br>
                But she moves so fast<br>
                That I can't keep up<br>
                I'm chasing<br>
                I'm in love with a shooting star<br>
                But she moves so fast<br>
                When she falls then<br>
